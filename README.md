# covid-entryway-bot

This repository hosts the code for Henry Anderson, Stephen Fisher, and Matt Mahoney's senior capstone project.
The Covid EntryWay Bot project built a device off of an Nvidia Jetson Nano microcontroller that is designed to authorize users on mask status.
In the event that a user is wearing a mask, they are dispensed hand sanitizer and accepted.
If not, a mask is dispensed for them and they must put it on before moving forward.
The I/O loop is controlled by a PIR sensor. Circuit diagrams for all components are available by request at hwa222@lehigh.edu.s
